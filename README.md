# Node.js Authentication with Passport

This is the companion app to an [article I wrote](https://medium.com/@rwillt/node-js-authentication-with-passport-4a125f264cd4) over on Medium. It demonstrates using [passport-local](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-local) and [bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js) in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)/[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) app.
